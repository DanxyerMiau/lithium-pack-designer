# Battery Pack Visualizer

A React TypeScript application for calculating and visualizing battery pack configurations with 3D modeling capabilities. Calculate optimal pack layouts for general use or e-bike applications, then generate 3D models with STL export for 3D printing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This tool is for educational and prototyping purposes only.** Battery pack design involves complex electrical, thermal, and safety considerations that this calculator does not fully address. The calculations and models provided:

- Are based on simplified assumptions and may not reflect real-world conditions
- Do not account for battery chemistry variations, temperature effects, or aging
- Should not be used as the sole basis for commercial or safety-critical applications
- May contain inaccuracies in calculations, dimensions, or 3D models

**Always consult with qualified electrical engineers and follow proper battery safety protocols when designing actual battery packs.** Lithium-ion batteries can be dangerous if mishandled.

## Features

- **Battery Pack Calculator**: Calculate series/parallel configurations for desired voltage and capacity
- **E-bike Range Estimator**: Specialized calculator for electric bike applications
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive Three.js models with realistic battery cell rendering
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate STL files for 3D printing battery holders and enclosures
- **Multiple Cell Types**: Support for 18650, 21700, 26650, and 32700 battery cells
- **SVG Layout Export**: 2D technical drawings with precise dimensions

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js and pnpm


1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. (Optional) Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) for AI features
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser

## Build for Production

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview  # Test production build locally
```

## Deployment

This application can be easily deployed to various hosting services. The build output is a static site that works with any static hosting provider.
